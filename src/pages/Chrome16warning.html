      Pardon me for interrupting, but I need to tell you:<br/>
      <h1>AdBlock is getting an upgrade.</h1>
      This new update requires that you are using <b>Chrome 17</b> or newer.<br/><br/>
      It seems the version you are using right now does not meet that requirement.<br/><br/>
      To update Chrome, click the <i>Wrench menu</i> &gt; <i>About Google Chrome</i> &gt; <i>Update now</i>.<br/>
      If you don't do this, AdBlock will <b>stop working</b> in a couple of weeks!<br/><br/>
      <span style="color: gray;">The update we will launch in a couple of weeks will improve the way ads are blocked and implement popup blocking, as well as blocking ads in videos</span><br/><br/>
