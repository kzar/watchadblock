      <h1>AdBlock is getting an upgrade.</h1>
      In about a week you will see this message in Chrome:
      <br/><br/>
      <img src="warning.png">
      <br/><br/>
      Be sure to <b>click "Re-enable"</b> when you see that message to turn AdBlock back on!
      <br/>
      <span style="font-size:small; color:gray">If you forget, you'll need to go to Wrench menu | Tools | Extensions to re-enable AdBlock.</span>
      <br/><br/><br/>

      <h2>Don't worry, this isn't scary.</h2>
      <br/>

      <span id="explanationtext">
        I'm just adding a toolbar button to AdBlock (which you can hide if you don't want it).
      </span>
      <script>
        // If they have the browser button extension installed, change the explanation.
        chrome.extension.sendRequest("picdndbpdnapajibahnnogkjofaeooof", {}, function() {
          $("#explanationtext").html("I'm just merging the <i>Browser Button for AdBlock</i> extension into AdBlock.");
        });
      </script>
      <br/><br/>
      The toolbar button needs permission to talk to your browser, causing this message to appear.  The specific
      permission it needs is called "view your browsing history", but rest assured that AdBlock isn't snooping on you.
      <br/><br/><br/>
      <h2>OK, that's all -- sorry to interrupt you!</h2><br/>
      I hope AdBlock makes you happy every day!  Lately AdBlock has added right-click ad-blocking support, true resource blocking to save your bandwidth, custom blacklist editing, and translation into 13 languages (and counting!)  Please consider <b><a href="http://chromeadblock.com/paypal_donate">donating</a> to keep AdBlock going</b>.  Pretty please?
      <br/><br/>- Michael
