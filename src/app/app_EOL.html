    <b>I'm retiring the $1.99 AdBlock app</b> because users can now pay what they want (including $0) for the AdBlock extension.<br/><br/>
    You can keep using the app if you want, but you should switch to the extension if you want to get updates with new features and bugfixes.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>To switch to the extension version:</b><br/>
    <ol>
      <li id="step1">Go to 
      <a href="http://chromeadblock.com" target="_blank">
      the AdBlock extension install page</a> and click 'Install'.</li>
      <li>Go to
      <a href="#" onclick='chrome.tabs.create({url:"chrome://extensions"});return false;'>your apps and extensions list</a>, search for 'AdBlock
      (app)' and click the 'Uninstall' link right below it.</li>
      <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>
    I'm sorry to be all up in your face with a popup window!  I won't bother
    you again about this.  If you've got questions or complaints, please email
    me at adblockforchrome@gmail.com and I'll be sure to reply.
    <br/><br/>
    Thank you so much for supporting AdBlock!<br/><br/>
