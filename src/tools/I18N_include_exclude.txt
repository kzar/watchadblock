This file contains all required I18N strings that could not be detected.  These
have to be hard-coded. 
Examples:
  The strings are built up as variables, like translate("filter" + filterid)
  The strings are used outside the extension, like getadblock.com/installed/
  The strings are no longer used but may be again later, like "betalabel"

Also, some strings are not necessary to translate like EasyPrivacy. 
EasyPrivacy however may be translated. For example if a translator wants to
make it 'EasyPrivacy (privacy protection list)'.

The syntax is very easy. Start a line with a + and it will include this as if it
was detected in the source files. Start a line with a - and it will not report
that string as a missing string.

The texts from manifest.json are not scanned
+description2
+adblock_click_for_details

Keep this one for future options
+betalabel

The filter list ids are appended by JS, and as this isn't a javascript parser,
these have to be hard-coded too...
