This file contains all I18N strings that could not be detected as the strings
are build up with variables, like translate("filter" + filterid). These have to
be hard-coded. Also, some strings are not necessary to translate like 
EasyPrivacy. EasyPrivacy however may be translated. For example if a translator
wants to make it 'EasyPrivacy (privacy protection list)'.

The syntax is very easy. Start a line with a + and it will include this as if it
was detected in the source files. Start a line with a - and it will not report
that string as a missing string.

The texts from manifest.json are not scanned

The filter list ids are appended by JS, and as this isn't a javascript parser,
these have to be hard-coded too...
